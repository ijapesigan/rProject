  abstract = {Autoregressive and vector autoregressive models are a driving force in current psychological research. In affect research they are, for instance, frequently used to formalize affective processes and estimate affective dynamics. Discrete-time model variants are most commonly used, but continuous-time formulations are gaining popularity, because they can handle data from longitudinal studies in which the sampling rate varies within the study period, and yield results that can be compared across data sets from studies with different sampling rates. However, whether and how the sampling rate affects the quality with which such continuous-time models can be estimated, has largely been ignored in the literature. In the present article, we show how the sampling rate affects the estimation reliability (i.e., the standard errors of the parameter estimators, with smaller values indicating higher reliability) of continuous-time autoregressive and vector autoregressive models. Moreover, we determine which sampling rates are optimal in the sense that they lead to standard errors of minimal size (subject to the assumption that the models are correct). Our results are based on the theories of optimal design and maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate them making use of data from the COGITO Study. We formulate recommendations for study planning, and elaborate on strengths and limitations of our approach.},
