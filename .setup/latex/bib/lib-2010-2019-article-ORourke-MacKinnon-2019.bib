  abstract = {This chapter describes the theoretical and practical importance of mediation analysis in substance-use prevention research. The most important reason for including mediators in a research study is to examine the mechanisms by which prevention programs influence substance-use outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which prevention programs achieve effects helps reduce the cost and increases effectiveness of prevention programs. This chapter first describes the theoretical foundations of the mediation model in prevention, and reasons for using mediation analysis in substance-use prevention. Next, we provide an overview of statistical mediation analysis for single and multiple mediator models. We summarize mediation analyses in substance-use prevention and discuss future directions for application of mediation analysis in substance-use research.},
