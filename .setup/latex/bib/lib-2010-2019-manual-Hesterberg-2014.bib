  abstract = {I have three goals in this article: \begin{enumerate} \item To show the enormous potential of bootstrapping and permutation tests to help students understand statistical concepts including sampling distributions, standard errors, bias, confidence intervals, null distributions, and P-values. \item To dig deeper, understand why these methods work and when they don't, things to watch out for, and how to deal with these issues when teaching. \item To change statistical practice---by comparing these methods to common $t$ tests and intervals, we see how inaccurate the latter are; we confirm this with asymptotics. $n \geq 30$ isn't enough---think $n \geq 5000$. \end{enumerate} Resampling provides diagnostics, and more accurate alternatives. Sadly, the common bootstrap percentile interval badly under-covers in small samples; there are better alternatives. The tone is informal, with a few stories and jokes.},
