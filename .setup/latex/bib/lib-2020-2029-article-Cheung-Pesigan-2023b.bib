  abstract = {There are three common types of confidence interval (CI) in structural equation modeling (SEM): Wald-type CI, bootstrapping CI, and likelihood-based CI (LBCI). LBCI has the following advantages: (1) it has better coverage probabilities and Type I error rate compared to Wald-type CI when the sample size is finite; (2) it correctly tests the null hypothesis of a parameter based on likelihood ratio chi-square difference test; (3) it is less computationally intensive than bootstrapping CI; and (4) it is invariant to transformations. However, LBCI is not available in many popular SEM software packages. We developed an R package, semlbci, for forming LBCI for parameters in models fitted by lavaan, a popular open-source SEM package, such that researchers have more options in forming CIs for parameters in SEM. The package supports both unstandardized and standardized estimates, derived parameters such as indirect effect, multisample models, and the robust LBCI proposed by Falk.},
