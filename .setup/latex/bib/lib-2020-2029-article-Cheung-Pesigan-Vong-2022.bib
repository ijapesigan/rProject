  abstract = {Researchers can generate bootstrap confidence intervals for some statistics in SPSS using the BOOTSTRAP command. However, this command can only be applied to selected procedures, and only to selected statistics in these procedures. We developed an extension command and prepared some sample syntax files based on existing approaches from the Internet to illustrate how researchers can (a) generate a large number of nonparametric bootstrap samples, (b) do desired analysis on all these samples, and (c) form the bootstrap confidence intervals for selected statistics using the OMS commands. We developed these tools to help researchers apply nonparametric bootstrapping to any statistics for which this method is appropriate, including statistics derived from other statistics, such as standardized effect size measures computed from the t test results. We also discussed how researchers can extend the tools for other statistics and scenarios they encounter.},
