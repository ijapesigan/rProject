  abstract = {Mediators are variables that explain the association between an independent variable and a dependent variable. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is widely used to test models with mediating effects. This article illustrates how to construct confidence intervals (CIs) of the mediating effects for a variety of models in SEM. Specifically, mediating models with 1 mediator, 2 intermediate mediators, 2 specific mediators, and 1 mediator in 2 independent groups are illustrated. By using phantom variables (Rindskopf, 1984), a Wald CI, percentile bootstrap CI, bias-corrected bootstrap CI, and a likelihood-based CI on the mediating effect are easily constructed with some existing SEM packages, such as LISREL, Mplus, and Mx. Monte Carlo simulation studies are used to compare the coverage probabilities of these CIs. The results show that the coverage probabilities of these CIs are comparable when the mediating effect is large or when the sample size is large. However, when the mediating effect and the sample size are both small, the bootstrap CI and likelihood-based CI are preferred over the Wald CI. Extensions of this SEM approach for future research are discussed.},
