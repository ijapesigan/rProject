  abstract = {The bootstrap, a computer-intensive approach to statistical data analysis, has been recommended as an alternative to parametric approaches. Advocates claim it is superior because it is not burdened by potentially unwarranted normal theory assumptions and because it retains information about the form of the original sample. Empirical support for its superiority, however, is quite limited. The present article compares the bootstrap and parametric approaches to estimating confidence intervals and Type I error rates of the correlation coefficient. The parametric approach is superior to the bootstrap under both assumption violation and nonviolation. The bootstrap results in overly restricted confidence intervals and overly liberal Type I error rates.},
