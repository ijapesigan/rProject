  abstract = {The results in a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis can be influenced by just a few observations, called influential cases. Tools have been developed for users of R to identify them. However, similar tools are not available for AMOS, which is also a popular SEM software package. We introduce the FINDOUT toolset, a group of SPSS extension commands, and an AMOS plugin, to identify influential cases and examine how these cases influence the results. The SPSS commands can be used either as syntax commands or as custom dialogs from pull-down menus, and the AMOS plugin can be run from AMOS pull-down menu. We believe these tools can help researchers to examine the robustness of their findings to influential cases.},
