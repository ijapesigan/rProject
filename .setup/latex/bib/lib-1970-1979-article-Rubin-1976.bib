  abstract = {When making sampling distribution inferences about the parameter of the data, $\theta$, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are `missing at random' and the observed data are `observed at random', but these inferences are generally conditional on the observed pattern of missing data. When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about $\theta$, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is `distinct' from $\theta$. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.},
