  abstract = {Contemporary psychometric policy and practice have tended to make the use of algebraic difference scores in psychological research taboo. Within the more limited domain of factor analytic research on personality, difference scores have been the subject of sporadic debate for more than 30 years. Using the personality trait versus state distinction as a substantive context, the fit of the factor analytic model to difference score data is investigated and found to be quite good. Methodological issues related to properties of difference scores and their implications for personality research are briefly discussed.},
