  abstract = {Structural equation models are presented as alternative models for examining longitudinal data. The models include (a) a cross-lagged regression model, (b) a factor model based on latent growth curves, and (c) a dynamic model based on latent difference scores. The illustrative data are on motivation and perceived competence of students during their first semester in high school. The 3 models yielded different results and such differences were discussed in terms of the conceptualization of change underlying each model. The last model was defended as the most reasonable for these data because it captured the dynamic interrelations between the examined constructs and, at the same time, identified potential growth in the variables.},
