  abtract = {A method using multiple imputation and bootstrap for dealing with missing data in mediation analysis is introduced and implemented in both SAS and R. Through simulation studies, it is shown that the method performs well for both MCAR and MAR data without and with auxiliary variables. It is also shown that the method can work for MNAR data if auxiliary variables related to missingness are included. The application of the method is demonstrated through the analysis of a subset of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Mediation analysis with missing data can be conducted using the provided SAS macros and R package bmem.},
