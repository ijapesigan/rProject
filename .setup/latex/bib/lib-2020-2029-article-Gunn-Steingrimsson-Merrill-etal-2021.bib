  abstract = {Introduction: Previous research has predominately relied on person-level or single characteristics of drinking episodes to characterise patterns of drinking that may confer risk. This research often relies on self-report measures. Advancements in wearable alcohol biosensors provide a multi-faceted objective measure of drinking. The current study aimed to characterise drinking episodes using data derived from a wearable alcohol biosensor. Methods: Participants ($n = 45$) were adult heavy drinkers who wore the Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM) bracelet and reported on their drinking behaviours. Cluster analysis was used to evaluate unique combinations of alcohol episode characteristics. Associations between clusters and self-reported person and event-level factors were also examined in univariable and multivariable models. Results: Results suggested three unique clusters: Cluster 1 (most common, slowest rate of rise to and decline from peak), Cluster 2 (highest peak transdermal alcohol concentration and area under the curve) and Cluster 3 (fastest rate of decline from peak). Univariable analyses distinguished Cluster 1 as having fewer self-reported drinks and fewer episodes that occurred on weekends relative to Cluster 2. The effect for number of drinks remained in multivariable analyses. Discussion and Conclusions: This is the first study to characterise drinking patterns at the event-level using objective data. Results suggest that it is possible to distinguish drinking episodes based on several characteristics derived from wearable alcohol biosensors. This examination lays the groundwork for future studies to characterise patterns of drinking and their association with consequences of drinking behaviour.
