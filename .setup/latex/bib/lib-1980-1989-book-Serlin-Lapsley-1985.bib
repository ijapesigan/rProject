  abstract = {Reexamines methodological and procedural issues raised by P. Meehl (1967; see also PA, Vol 62:5042) that question the rationality of psychological inquiry. Issues concern the asymmetry in theory testing between psychology and physics and the slow progress observed in psychological research. A good-enough principle is proposed to resolve Meehl's methodological paradox, and a more powerful reconstruction of science developed by I. Lakatos (1978) is suggested to account for the actual practice of psychological researchers.},
