  abstract = {Both the standard jackknife and a weighted jackknife are investigated in the general linear model situation. Properties of bias reduction and standard error estimation are derived and the weighted jackknife shown to be superior for unbalanced data. There is a preliminary discussion of robust regression fitting using jackknife pseudo-values.},
