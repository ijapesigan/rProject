  abstract = {Wrist-worn alcohol biosensors continuously and discreetly record transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) and may allow alcohol researchers to monitor alcohol consumption in participantsâ€™ natural environments. However, the field lacks established methods for signal processing and detecting alcohol events using these devices. We developed software that streamlines analysis of raw data (TAC, temperature, and motion) from a wrist-worn alcohol biosensor (BACtrack Skyn) through a signal processing and machine learning pipeline: biologically implausible skin surface temperature readings (< 28C) were screened for potential device removal and TAC artifacts were corrected, features that describe TAC (e.g., rise duration) were calculated and used to train models (random forest and logistic regression) that predict self-reported alcohol consumption, and model performances were measured and summarized in autogenerated reports. The software was tested using 60 Skyn data sets recorded during 30 alcohol drinking episodes and 30 nonalcohol drinking episodes. Participants (N = 36; 13 with alcohol use disorder) wore the Skyn during one alcohol drinking episode and one nonalcohol drinking episode in their natural environment. In terms of distinguishing alcohol from nonalcohol drinking, correcting artifacts in the data resulted in 10\% improvement in model accuracy relative to using raw data. Random forest and logistic regression models were both accurate, correctly predicting 97\% (58/60; AUC-ROCs = 0.98, 0.96) of episodes. Area under TAC curve, rise duration of TAC curve, and peak TAC were the most important features for predictive accuracy. With promising model performance, this protocol will enhance the efficiency and reliability of TAC sensors for future alcohol monitoring research.},
