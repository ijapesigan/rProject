  abstract = {In the domain of building and testing theory, mediation relationships are among the most important that can be proposed. Mediation helps to explicate our theoretical models (Leavitt, Mitchell, \& Peterson, 2010) and addresses the fundamental question of why two constructs are related (Whetten, 1989). One of the better-known methods for testing mediation is commonly referred to as the ``Sobel test,'' named for the researcher who derived a standard error (Sobel, 1982) to test the significance of the indirect effect. Recently, a number of different research teams (e.g., Preacher \& Hayes, 2004; Shrout \& Bolger, 2002) have criticized the Sobel test because this standard error requires an assumption of normality for the indirect effect sampling distribution. This distribution tends to be positively skewed (i.e,. not normal), particularly in small samples, and so this assumption can be problematic (Preacher \& Hayes, 2004; Stone \& Sobel, 1990). As a result, the statistical power of the Sobel test may be lessened in these contexts (Preacher \& Hayes 2004; Shrout \& Bolger, 2002). In light of this concern, some scholars have advocated instead for the use of bootstrapping to test the significance of the indirect effect (e.g.. Shrout \& Bolger 2002). Bootstrapping requires no a priori assumption about the shape of the sampling distribution because this distribution is empirically estimated using a resampling procedure (Efron \& Tibshirani, 1993). As a result, departures from normality are less troublesome when creating a confidence interval for the indirect effect. For this reason, bootstrapping is now widely believed to be inherently superior to the Sobel test when testing the significance of the indirect effect in organizational research. Our position is that this belief constitutes an urban legend. As with all statistical urban legends, there is an underlying kernel of truth to the belief that bootstrapping is superior to the Sobel test. However, as we discuss in this chapter, there are several reasons to be concerned with a broad belief in the superiority of bootstrapping. We begin with a brief overview of mediation testing focusing on the Sobel test and bootstrapping and then explain the underlying kernel of truth that has propelled bootstrapping to the forefront of mediation testing in organizational research. Subsequently, we discuss four areas of concern that cast doubt on the belief of the inherent superiority of bootstrapping. Finally, we conclude with recommendations concerning the future of mediation testing in organizational research.},
