  abstract = {Ever since its introduction, the bootstrap has provided both a powerful set of solutions for practical statisticians, and a rich source of theoretical and methodological problems for statistics. In this article, some recent developments in bootstrap methodology are reviewed and discussed. After a brief introduction to the bootstrap, we consider the following topics at varying levels of detail: the use of bootstrapping for highly accurate parametric inference; theoretical properties of nonparametric bootstrapping with unequal probabilities; subsampling and the $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap; bootstrap failures and remedies for superefficient estimators; recent topics in significance testing; bootstrap improvements of unstable classifiers and resampling for dependent data. The treatment is telegraphic rather than exhaustive.},

  abstract = {The contemporary development of bootstrap methods, from the time of Efron's early articles to the present day, is well documented and widely appreciated. Likewise, the relationship of bootstrap techniques to certain early work on permutation testing, the jackknife and cross-validation is well understood. Less known, however, are the connections of the bootstrap to research on survey sampling for spatial data in the first half of the last century or to work from the 1940s to the 1970s on subsampling and resampling. In a selective way, some of these early linkages will be explored, giving emphasis to developments with which the statistics community tends to be less familiar. Particular attention will be paid to the work of P. C. Mahalanobis,	whose development in the 1930s and 1940s of moving-block sampling methods for spatial data has a range of interesting features, and to contributions of other scientists who, during the next 40 years, developed half-sampling, subsampling and resampling methods.},

Modifications to Efron's definition of the bootstrap are needed to make the idea work for modern procedures that are not classically regular.},

Another important area in which bootstrap has proved its use is in the context of detecting the problem of multiple roots and searching for the consistent root of an estimating function. In this article, I review, compare and contrast various approaches for bootstrapping estimating functions.},

In this paper, we critically review various bootstrap methods developed to deal with these challenging issues. We discuss two applications where the bootstrap has been found to be effective.},

Consequently, the availability of valid nonparametric inference procedures based on resampling and/or subsampling has freed practitioners from the necessity of resorting to simplifying assumptions such as normality or linearity that may be misleading.},

But careful reading of Efron (1979) will show that at its heart, the bootstrap is a ``plug-in'' procedure that involves calculating a functional $\theta \left( \hat{F} \right)$ from an estimate of the c.d.f. $F$. Resampling becomes invaluable when, as is often the case, $\theta \left( \hat{F} \right)$ cannot be calculated explicitly. We discuss some situations where working with the sample quantile function, $\hat{Q}$, rather than $\hat{F}$, can lead to explicit (exact) solutions to $\theta \left( \hat{F} \right)$.},

  doi = {10.1214/ss/1063994980},
  number = {2},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {With the increasing emphasis in biology on reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, questions have arisen as to how confident one should be in a given phylogenetic tree and how support for phylogenetic trees should be measured. Felsenstein suggested that bootstrapping be applied across characters of a taxon-by-character data matrix to produce replicate ``bootstrap data sets,'' each of which is then analyzed phylogenetically, with a consensus tree constructed to summarize the results of all replicates. The proportion of trees/replicates in which a grouping is recovered is presented as a measure of support for that group. Bootstrapping has become a common feature of phylogenetic analysis. However, the interpretation of bootstrap values remains open to discussion, and phylogeneticists have used these values in multiple ways. The usefulness of phylogenetic bootstrapping is potentially limited by a number of features, such as the size of the data matrix and the underlying assumptions of the phylogeny reconstruction program. Recent studies have explored the application of bootstrapping to large data sets and the relative performance of bootstrapping and jackknifing.},

  abstract = {Bradley Efron is Professor of Statistics and Biostatistics at Stanford University. He works on a combination of theoretical and applied topics, including empirical Bayes, survival analysis, exponential families, bootstrap and jackknife methods and confidence intervals. Most of his applied work has originated in biomedical consulting projects at the Stanford Medical School, mixed in with a few papers concerning astronomy and physics. Even his theoretical papers usually begin with specific applied problems. All three of the interviewers here have been close scientific collaborators.
  Brad was born in St. Paul, Minnestora, May 1938, to Esther and Miles Efron, Jewish-Russian immigrants. A Merit Scholarship, in the program's inaugural year, brought him to Caltech, graduating in Mathematics in 1960. He arrived at Stanford that Fall, eventually gaining his Ph.D., under the direction of Rupert Miller and Herb Solomon, in the Statistics Department, whose faculty also included Charles Stein, Herman Chernoff, Manny Parzen, Lincoln Moses and Ingram Olkin. Brad has lived at Stanford since 1960, with sabbaticals at Harvard, Imperial College and Berkeley. He has held several administrative positions in the university:	Chair of Statistics, Associate Dean of Science, Chairman of the University Advisory Board and Chair of the Faculty Senate. He is currently Chair of the Undergraduate Program in Applied Mathematics.
  Honors include doctorates from Chicago, Madrid and Oslo, a MacArthur Prize Fellowship, membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, fellowship in the IMS and ASA, the Wilks Medal, Parzen Prize, the newly inaugurated Rao Prize and the outstanding statistician award from the Chicago ASA chapter. He has been the Rietz, Wald, and Fisher lecturers and holds the Max H. Stein endowed chair as Professor of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford. Professional service includes Theory and Methods Editor of JASA and President of the IMS. Currently he is President-Elect of the American Statistical Association, becoming President in 2004.},
