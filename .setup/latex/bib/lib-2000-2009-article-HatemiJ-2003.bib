  abstract = {A crucial aspect of empirical research based on the vector autoregressive (VAR) model is the choice of the lag order, since all inference in the VAR model is based on the chosen lag order. Here, a new information criterion is introduced for this purpose. The conducted Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that this new information criterion performs well in picking the true lag order in stable as well as unstable VAR models.},
