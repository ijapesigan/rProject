  abstract = {The bootstrap is a nonparametric technique for estimating standard errors and approximate confidence intervals. Rasmussen has used a simulation experiment to suggest that bootstrap confidence intervals perform very poorly in the estimation of a correlation coefficient. Part of Rasmussen's simulation is repeated. A careful look at the results shows the bootstrap intervals performing quite well. Some remarks are made concerning the virtues and defects of bootstrap intervals in general.},
