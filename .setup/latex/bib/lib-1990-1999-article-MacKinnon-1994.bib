  abstract = {Mediational analysis is one way to test specific hypotheses derived from theory. Although this analysis has been suggested in the prevention literature, mediation analysis rarely is conducted. As the field of prevention matures, more questions about how prevention programs work (or fail to work) will emerge. Studies of mediation can address these questions, thereby reducing the cost and enhancing the impact of prevention programs. The methods outlined here can be applied in the evaluation of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs. Since most prevention studies include measurement of some mediating constructs, mediation effects can be assessed on many existing data sets. Mediation analysis can be used to test ideas about prevention.},
