  abstract = {Background: Wearable transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) sensors allow passive monitoring of alcohol concentration in natural settings and measurement of multiple features from drinking episodes, including peak intoxication level, speed of intoxication (absorption rate) and elimination, and duration. These passively collected features extend commonly used self-reported drink counts and may facilitate the prediction of alcohol-related consequences in natural settings, aiding risk stratification and prevention efforts. Method: A total of 222 young adults aged 21-29 ($M_{\mathrm{age}} = 22.3$, 64 female, 79\% non-Hispanic white, 84\% undergraduates) who regularly drink heavily participated in a 5-day study that included the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of alcohol consumption (daily morning reports and participant-initiated episodic EMA sequences) and the wearing of TAC sensors (SCRAM-CAM anklets). The analytic sample contained 218 participants and 1274 days (including 554 self-reported drinking days). Five features—area under the curve (AUC), peak TAC, rise rate (rate of absorption), fall rate (rate of elimination), and duration—were extracted from TAC-positive trajectories for each drinking day. Day- and person-level associations of TAC features with drink counts (morning and episodic EMA) and alcohol-related consequences were tested using multilevel modeling. Results: TAC features were strongly associated with morning drink reports ($r$ = 0.60.7) but only moderately associated with episodic EMA drink counts ($r$ = 0.30.5) at both day and person levels. Higher peaks, larger AUCs, faster rise rates, and faster fall rates were significantly predictive of day-level alcohol-related consequences after adjusting for both morning and episodic EMA drink counts in separate models. Person means of TAC features added little above daily scores to the prediction of alcohol-related consequences. Conclusions: These results support the utility of TAC sensors in studies of alcohol misuse among young adults in natural settings and outline the specific TAC features that contribute to the day-level prediction of alcohol-related consequences. TAC sensors provide a passive option for obtaining valid and unique information predictive of drinking risk in natural settings.
