\maketitle

Follow the Google R style guide (\url{https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html}) as much as possible.
Note that the Google R style guide is a fork of the Tidyverse style guide (\url{https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html})
with some changes most notably with regard to function names.
Thus, only flags that relate to function names
are allowed when running \texttt{lintr}.

\section{R Objects}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{snake\_case} for object names except for function names
\end{itemize}

\section{R Functions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item use \texttt{BigCamelCase} for function names to distinguish functions from other objects 
    \item append a dot (\texttt{.}) at the beginning for unexported functions (\texttt{.Foo})
    \item append dot Check (\texttt{.Check}) at the beginning for unexported functions used for sanity checks (\texttt{.CheckFoo})
    \item when calling functions from another package use the \texttt{::} notation as much as possible (\texttt{stats::rnorm(n = 10, mean = 100, sd = 15)})
    \item when calling a function, use argument names as much as possible (\texttt{stats::rnorm(n = 10, mean = 100, sd = 15)})
\end{itemize}

\section{File and Filenames}

\begin{itemize}
    \item filenames should be in lowercase using dash (\texttt{-}) as separator
    \item capitalize \texttt{R} if used as a file extension
\end{itemize}
